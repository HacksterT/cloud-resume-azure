## Development Approach
We've adopted a streamlined approach focusing on:
1. Direct HTML/CSS implementation for faster development
2. Single-file architecture for easier maintenance
3. Built-in styling without external dependencies
4. Static content for reliable performance
5. Interactive features for better user engagement

## Deployment
1. **Local Development**
   - Clone the repository
   - Open `frontend/index.html` in a browser for local testing

2. **Azure Deployment**
   - Deploy to Azure Static Web Apps
   - Configure custom domain (if applicable)
   - Verify all assets and presentations are properly loaded

## Maintenance
To update the resume:
1. Make changes to the relevant sections in `index.html`
2. Test locally to ensure all features work as expected
3. Commit changes to Git
4. Push to Azure Storage for deployment
