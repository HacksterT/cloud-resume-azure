## Development Approach
We've adopted a streamlined approach focusing on:
1. Direct HTML/CSS implementation for faster development
2. Single-file architecture for easier maintenance

4. Static content for reliable performance
5. Optimized JavaScript for smooth interactions

### Benefits of This Approach

- **Easier Maintenance**: All content in one place
- **Better Performance**: No external dependencies or API calls
- **Simplified Deployment**: Easy to deploy to Azure Static Web Apps
- **Enhanced UX**: Smooth navigation and section management

## Next Steps
1. **Content Refinement**
